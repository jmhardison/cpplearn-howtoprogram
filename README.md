# C++ - How to Program

This is just a collection of projects and files associated to the book I'm reading through to 're-learn' C++.
Too long ago I once invested time into this language, and decided to again.

Why? Something something something.... dark side....

Also of note, I'm doing this endeavour with CLion from JetBrains. VSCode would work great too, but I have an affinity for JetBrains. Deal with it. Ok maybe some VSCode too.
